% SECTION 1 - The Project and Its Goals
\section{The Project and Its Goals}
The following describes the \textbf{SustainCity} project and its goals to be achieved, developed as part of the \textbf{Software Engineering for HPC} course. We structured this first section into three key parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Preface}, introducing the broader environmental and urban challenges motivating this project.
    \item The \textbf{Problem Posed}, describing in detail the technical and society issues to be addressed.
    \item The \textbf{Project Goals}, outlining the core functionalities and expected outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Preface}
Two urgent global concerns are environmental sustainability and climate change; because of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, transportation - especially urban commuting - worsens those issues. 
\\ \\ The objective of the SustainCity project is to face urban mobility challenges through real-time traffic management, event-driven optimizations, and public transport coordination. 
\\ \\To address these concerns, the project integrates traffic monitoring, event planning, and transport analytics into an adaptive system capable of creating data-driven recommendations for real-time city infrastructure improvements. 
\\ \\Thanks to these system recommendations, urban commuting can be drastically reduced, improving both citizens’ well-being and environmental sustainability.

\subsection*{Problem Statement}
The \textbf{SustainCity} system aims to optimize urban traffic using three key strategies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real-time Traffic Optimization (Type1 Actions)} 
    The system continuously adapts traffic light timings using real-time congestion data to optimize flow.  
    \item \textbf{Long-term Traffic Pattern Analysis (Type2 Actions)}  
    The system analyzes daily congestion patterns to recommend permanent adjustments, such as one-way street configurations, adaptive traffic signal schedules, and public transport optimizations.
    \item \textbf{Event-driven Traffic Management (Type3 Actions)}
    SustainCity monitors city event feeds (e.g., concerts, fairs, sports games) and adjusts road and transport infrastructure dynamically to reduce congestion during high-footfall gatherings.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Additionally, SustainCity generates \textbf{reports for urban planners and citizens}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Daily Reports}: Summarizing average traffic flows and actions taken (Type1).
    \item \textbf{Yearly Reports}: Documenting major infrastructure proposals (Type2, Type3) and their implementation status (accepted/rejected).
\end{itemize}

\noindent To accomplish these goals, we can rely on the following elements: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item A preexisting infrastructure offering sensors that measure the number of seconds cars need to cross each intersection. This infrastructure is developed according to the event-based style. All sensors periodically publish the data they have acquired on a message bus. 
    \item A microservice offering information about public transport schedules. In particular, this microservice offers the following operations: 
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item \textbf{getScheduleByStreet}: Given the name of a street, it returns the timetable of all stops present on that street. 
        \item \textbf{getScheduleByLine}: Given the number of a specific line, it returns the complete timetable for that line.   
    \end{itemize}
    \item A news channel that transmits information about the events in the city as soon as they are planned.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Project Goals}
Our main goal was to develop a software system that creates efficient, sustainable urban transport solutions by providing data-driven recommendations. Therefore, the document aims to meet two objectives: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensuring all functional and technical requirements are met.
    \item Designing a scalable, efficient, and well-structured urban-mobility solution.
\end{itemize}

% SECTION 2 - Requirement Analysis
\section{Requirement Analysis}
\subsection{Relevant Human and Non-Human Actors}
Let's begin by examining the \textit{human actors} involved in this system first:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Traffic Engineers} (Type1): They supervise and verify the correct functioning of the automatic traffic light regulation system. They take action in the event of malfunction, validate traffic management strategies, and analyze logs for future improvements.
    \item \textbf{Urban Area Manager} (Type1, Type2, Type3): They are responsible for overseeing urban infrastructure, long-term policies and constraints related to dynamic traffic light regulation. They also evaluate traffic optimization proposals and approve or reject recommendations related to traffic configurations, transportation scheduling, and road management. Their decisions directly impact the effectiveness of SustainCity's long-term strategies.
    \item \textbf{City Planners and Officials} (Type 1, Type2, Type3): Work alongside \textbf{Urban Area Managers} to assess traffic data reports, evaluate permanent infrastructure adaptations, and implement policy changes based on recommendations. They ensure that adjustments are in accordance with environmental and urban regulations. They may also be involved in the approval and monitoring of automated traffic regulation systems.
    \item \textbf{Citizens}(Type1, Type2, Type3): Although not actively involved in the system’s technical workings, they are end-users who benefit from improved traffic conditions, congestion reduction, and optimized public transport schedules. They receive notifications through city mobility platforms, public dashboards, transport apps, and digital road signs.
\end{itemize}
\noindent On the other hand, there are also several \textit{non-human actors} needed to ensure the system operates efficiently and delivers accurate data-driven insights:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Traffic Management System} (Type1, Type2, Type3): Acts as the core analytical component by collecting, processing, and interpreting data from various sources, such as traffic sensors. This actor continuously monitors daily traffic flows, identifies congestion hot spots, and detects recurring traffic patterns that could benefit from optimization.
    \item \textbf{Public Transport Microservice} (Type2, Type3): Provides comprehensive and real-time public transport schedules. By integrating this microservice, the system can propose modifications to transport schedules, aligning them with identified traffic patterns to optimize commuter convenience and reduce congestion.
    \item \textbf{Sensors} (Type1, Type2, Type3): Physical devices deployed at intersections and major roadways; these actors gather real-time data about traffic conditions. Accurate and timely sensor data is foundational, enabling the system to analyze traffic patterns and propose meaningful optimizations reliably.
    \item \textbf{Event Monitoring System} (Type3): Detects and transmits event schedules (concerts, sports games, fairs), triggering event-driven traffic adjustments and real-time mobility recommendations. It works closely with the \textbf{Traffic Management System} and \textbf{Public Transport Microservice} to prevent congestion.
    \item \textbf{Notification System} (Type1, Type3): A critical component for disseminating structured reports and real-time alerts to all relevant actors. It ensures that traffic management decisions — whether real-time, event-driven, or long-term — are properly communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection{Use Cases}
\subsubsection{Type1 use cases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Traffic Monitoring}: The system continuously receives data from sensors installed at key intersections. These sensors measure metrics such as vehicle wait times and traffic density, enabling the system to maintain an up-to-date view of traffic flow throughout the city.
    \item \textbf{Traffic Flow Evaluation}: Based on the incoming sensor data, the system evaluates whether a significant traffic imbalance exists between intersecting roads. If, for example, road A consistently shows higher vehicle throughput compared to the crossing road B, the system flags this as a condition that may require intervention.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Light Adjustment Decision}: When specific thresholds or patterns are detected (for instance, sustained congestion or excessive delay on one road), the system automatically determines whether to extend the green light duration on the congested road. This decision is made using pre-defined traffic management rules or adaptive algorithms.
    \item \textbf{Actuation of Traffic Light Changes}: Once a decision is made, the system sends commands to the traffic light infrastructure to apply the updated timing configuration. This change is typically temporary (e.g., valid for the next hour), and will be re-evaluated in the next monitoring cycle.

    \item \textbf{Logging of Actions}: Every automatic intervention performed by the system is logged with relevant metadata, including timestamp, affected intersections, traffic conditions, and rationale behind the decision. This log is crucial for transparency, auditing, and future system refinements.

    \item \textbf{Daily Report Generation}: At the end of each day, the system compiles a report summarizing traffic trends on main roads and detailing all Type1 actions performed. This report is made publicly available to inform citizens and assist urban planners in understanding traffic evolution and system effectiveness.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Type2 use cases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Traffic Pattern Analysis}: The system continuously processes daily traffic data gathered from city-wide sensors to detect patterns and identify areas frequently experiencing congestion or inefficient traffic flow. By understanding traffic behaviors over time, it can pinpoint critical issues, such as bottlenecks caused by suboptimal traffic light timing, inefficient road layouts, or misaligned public transport schedules. Recognizing these patterns is essential for accurately suggesting targeted interventions.
    \item \textbf{Suggest Optimizations}: Utilizing insights gained from the traffic pattern analysis, the system generates actionable recommendations aimed at reducing congestion and improving overall commuting efficiency. These recommendations include adjusting the duration and synchronization of traffic lights, revising street directions (e.g., converting roads into one-way streets), and modifying public transportation schedules to better align with commuter patterns. These suggestions are then systematically communicated to urban area managers for review.
    \item \textbf{Review and Apply Changes}: In this use case, urban area managers critically examine the optimization suggestions provided by the system. They evaluate the practicality, potential impact, and feasibility of each recommendation before making decisions. Approved suggestions are subsequently implemented within the city’s infrastructure, directly influencing urban commuting conditions. Suggestions deemed impractical or undesirable are rejected, with the decision outcomes logged and documented for reporting purposes.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Type3 use cases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Event Classification}: The system continuously monitors official event sources to identify upcoming large-scale events, categorizing them by size, location, and expected traffic impact and, based on these classifications, determining the level of intervention required.
    \item \textbf{Traffic Disruption Forecasting}: Utilizing historical traffic data, real-time congestion monitoring, and event classification, the system predicts potential disruptions, estimating increased traffic flow around event venues and surrounding areas. This enables early planning to mitigate issues before they arise.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Mobility Adaptation}: Based on the disruption forecasts, the system generates **adjustments for road configurations, public transport schedules, and pedestrian accessibility**. This includes rerouting vehicles, modifying traffic light timings, and increasing transit frequency for high-demand locations.
    \item \textbf{Approval and Policy Coordination}: All proposed modifications require validation by the \textbf{Urban Area Manager} and associated city officials. The system presents data-driven recommendations to policymakers, ensuring that any temporary or permanent changes align with long-term urban planning goals.
    \item \textbf{Public Engagement and Notification}: Once decisions are finalized, the \textbf{Notification System} disseminates structured alerts to citizens and commuters via mobile apps, city dashboards, and public transport displays. Notifications include alternative routes, expected delays, and temporary service modifications.
    \item \textbf{Post-Event Traffic Normalization}: After event completion, the system monitors post-event traffic flow to assess recovery patterns, restoring standard transport configurations while analyzing the effectiveness of applied modifications. Insights gathered contribute to future optimizations for recurring events.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection{Domain Assumptions}

The correct operation of the system is based on the following cross-cutting assumptions, organized by thematic area and referencing the relevant use case types (Type1, Type2, Type3).

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textit{Sensor Infrastructure Reliability} (Type1, Type2, Type3): The system assumes that traffic sensors deployed across the city, especially at intersections and major roads, are consistently operational. These sensors provide essential real-time data for adaptive traffic light control (Type1), daily traffic pattern analysis (Type2), and congestion prediction during large events (Type3).

    \item \textit{Autonomous Traffic Light Control} (Type1): The system is authorized to autonomously adjust traffic light timings based on real-time sensor data, without prior approval. These adjustments target immediate traffic imbalances and are the foundation for reactive traffic management.

    \item \textit{Urban Area Manager Oversight} (Type2, Type3): Although the system can autonomously manage traffic lights, larger changes, such as reconfiguring roads or updating public transport schedules, require approval from urban area managers. Their role ensures that data-driven suggestions align with long-term urban planning.

    \item \textit{Public Transport Data Availability} (Type2, Type3): The system relies on up-to-date access to the public transport microservice, providing accurate timetables and real-time data. This supports both optimization of daily operations (Type2) and event-based rerouting (Type3).

    \item \textit{Event Data Feeds} (Type3): The system assumes continuous access to official city event schedules, allowing early detection of high-impact gatherings and preparation of mobility strategies accordingly.

    \item \textit{Inter-System Communication} (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3): Reliable and stable network infrastructure is essential to enable seamless communication among the traffic management system, microservices, event monitoring module, sensors, and urban manager interfaces. Delays or failures in communication could hinder real-time reactions (Type1), the generation of optimization proposals (Type2), and the coordination of event-driven responses (Type3).

    \item \textit{Logging and Traceability} (Type1, Type2): All system actions, especially autonomous interventions and proposed suggestions, are assumed to be automatically logged. This ensures accountability, supports auditing by human actors, and enables future analysis.

    \item \textit{Real-Time Processing Capabilities} (Type1, Type3): The system is assumed to be capable of real-time or near-real-time decision-making, which is essential for reacting to live traffic conditions (Type1) and dynamically adapting to disruptions during events (Type3).

    \item \textit{Public Awareness and Engagement} (Type3): For event-driven adjustments to be effective, it is assumed that citizens actively consult and respond to the notifications distributed through the system. Informed commuters are critical to mitigating congestion during critical timeframes.
